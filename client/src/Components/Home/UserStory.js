        I was the designer for two weddings both happening within weeks of each
        other. One wedding party had 6 bridesmaids and the other had 10. I had
        to lug around several binders that held everyone's measurements, color
        preferences, and notes I had taken for each gown that would be made. I
        misplaced one of the binders and lost months worth of data. I was never
        able to retrieve the original measurements which was disappointing to
        all. It added unnecessary extra work and hastle. Needless to say, the
        bride wasn't pleased. A friend later told me about S&T. This would have
        been my lifesaver had I had this tool at that time.
